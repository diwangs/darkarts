# Private NFT Transfer ðŸŽ¨
Anonymously transfer ERC-721 NFT with zero-knowledge proofs

## Develop
### Build 
- Build all circuits and contracts
```
npm run build
```

### Test
- End-to-end test: deposit, send, withdraw
- Make sure that your absolute path doesn't contain whitespaces
```
npx truffle test test/vault.js
```

### Note on zokkrates-js
The latest version (1.0.38) is bugged since it doesn't include the necessary 
WASM binary, and the recommended working version (1.0.24) doesn't support for
loops properly. So this repo assumes that you will compile zokrates-js manually
and copy them to `node_modules`:
1. Clone the `ZoKrates` repo
2. Do `npm build` in the `zokrates_js` folder
3. Copy `npm/pkg` to this repo's `node_modules`

## Usage Flow and Comparison With tornado.cash
The flow of this app is similar to that of tornado.cash. The contract acts like some sort of mixnet pool:
1. User deposit their token to the contract with their proof pre-image commitment
2. Some time later, user withdraw their token by providing a zk-proof of the knowledge of those pre-image
3. The contract invalidates the commitment to prevent double spending

This original flow however, doesn't really work for NFT. The non-fungible nature of the token is itself an identifying information that is not hidden by this scheme (i.e. you can infer the previous owner of the token by following the transaction graph of _that particular token_) 

We solve this problem by (among many other things) adding a 'send' function that anonymously changes the rightful withdrawer of the token while keeping the token inside the contract, thus hiding the transaction graph.

## Details
### Second Address
We added an additional keypair for a user to identify themselves within the system. In other words, in order anonymously send an NFT to someone else, you don't provide your Ethereum address. Instead, you use this second address from the public key of this new keypair.

We feel the need to introduce a new address because of the lack of ECDSA (signing algorithm used by Ethereum) library in current SNARK toolbox (circom and zokrates only supports EdDSA). You can think of this address as having a similar function to z-address in Zcash.

Currently, we just use a simple random bits as our secret key and its Pedersen hash as the public key / address.

### Commitment Structure
The proof pre-image commitment consists of 3 things:
- __Second address__, to signify the rightful withdrawer of a token
- __Nullifier__, to signify the validity of the commitment and prevent double-spending
- __Token ID__, to signify which token is backed by this commitment

### Send Function
While the deposit and withdrawal functionality of this project is similar to tornado.cash with some minor adjustments, the send functionality is novel. Its high-level function is basically a combination of withdrawal and deposit, and is similar to the 'Pour' functionality from the Zerocash paper:
- User proves that they own the token (i.e. proves that they know the commitment pre-image)
- User submits a new commitment signifying the new owner
- User proves that the Token ID of this new commitment is the same as the Token ID of the old commitment
- The contract invalidates the old commitment
